## Highlighting projects I have made from COMM 493: AI Powered Business Decisions
The enclosed projects showcase various applications of machine learning using AWS.

## Project 1: S&P 500 Future Value Prediction - Supervised Machine Learning - Linear Regression (Linear Learner)
This project aims to predict the future value of the S&P 500 using linear regression and historic data. It uses 80 unique inputs and historic data to predict the next close of the S&P 500. This project uses AWS Sagemaker, S3, and the Linear Learner algorithm for regression.

## Project 2: Financial Headlines Sentiment Analysis - Supervised Machine Learning - Multi-Class Classification (Blazing Text)
This project aims to analyze financial news headlines and classify it as positive, negative, or neutral. This project uses AWS Sagemaker, S3, and the Blazing Text algorithm for multi-class classification.

## Project 3: Bank Market Success Identification Tool - Unsupervised Machine Learning - K-Means Clustering (K-means)
This project aims to analyze customer history to identify ideal customers. This project uses AWS Sagemaker, Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and Cloud9. This project includes a web based interface for banking employees to use to access the model and call with customer information to identify whether they fall into their target audience.
